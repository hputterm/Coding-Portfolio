Examples involving recurrent neural networks and adversarial attatcks.

### Hidden Markov Models

HMM contains my implementation of the Viterbi Algorithm, Forwards-Backwards Algorithm, and Baum-Welch Algorithm for the training of first order hidden markov models.  This implementation was used for generative modeling of Shakespeare and the constitution.

### Matrix Factorization

This repo contains an implementation of matrix factorization both with and without biases.  This model was trained using stochastic gradient descent.  Using singular value decomposition the results of this matrix factorization could be used to visualize the similarities between different objects.  

### Kaggle Competition
https://github.com/Whillikers/CS155-Miniproject-1

Here is the link to the repo for the code my team used for the Kaggle competition to get the highest combined score.  For the competition I mainly worked on finding the optimal architectures for neural networks, gradient boosted classifiers, and polynomial support vector machines.  Bagging and ensembling were used to produce our finals classifiers.

### Biology Simulations and Cell Computer Vision Analysis

The Gene Expression and Genetic Drift Simulations were both projects done in a biology class I took.  They required extensive use of python to do scientific analysis and simulations.  For instance in the Gene Expression project I used computer vision to identify cells on microscope images and then analyze the fluorescence content to determine the degree of gene expression.  In the Genetic Drift project I used Monte Carlo simulations to model the behavior of populations over time in the presence of external factors that affected their genetic viability.  This is just a small sample of the scientific simulations done during the class.

### IOS Applications

The Graphing Calculator and Twitter Application were both loosely a part of a Stanford course on IOS development.   Both of these applications were programmed in swift.  In the future I plan on reworking the model for the calculator to make it use a priority system when parsing to string.  Currently there are still some bugs left in this part of the project.  
Here are the links to the repos with the applications

### Othello Bot

The Othello bot was the result of a group project for a competition at the end of a class.  Me and my partner implemented parts of the board representation, a heuristic to represent the state of the game, and the recursive decision methods used to find the most optimal move.  The bot initially used a plain minimax decision tree to choose the best move.  By adding alpha beta pruning we were able to increase the recursive depth achieved by the bot in the limited time available to it.  This bot was written in c++.
